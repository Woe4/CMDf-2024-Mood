Description:
A mood-tracking app that sends users a notification at a random time throughout the day, encouraging users to record their realistic emotions and feelings.

App Features:
1. A general "home" page that displays a user's monthly stats. This includes the user's monthly average 'mood' as well as the user's most frequently chosen sentiments.
2. A mood recorder. This is available for the rest of the day, starting from when the user receives their daily notification. Users will first choose their mood on a slider, then choose a more specific sentiment.
3. A calendar page, which displays the current month. Each tracked day is filled in with the logged mood/colour for that day. Clicking on a given day will display that day's recorded mood and sentiment. Users can scroll between months using arrow keys.
4. Friend matching, where users with similar moods and sentiments are automatically matched with each other and have an opportunity to connect.
